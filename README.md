Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Sign in to your Google Account
Go to the [Google Account page](https://myaccount.google.com/) and sign in with the Google account that you want to generate the App Password for.

### 2. Navigate to Security Settings
Go to the "Security" section. You can usually find this by clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner, then selecting "Manage your Google Account," and finally, selecting the "Security" tab on the left sidebar.

### 3. Find App Passwords
Look for the option labeled "App passwords" or "App-specific passwords."

### 4. Generate App Password
Click on the "App passwords" or "App-specific passwords" option. You may be prompted to re-enter your Google account password for security purposes.

### 5. Select App and Device
Choose "Mail" as the app and "Other (Custom name)" as the device.

### 6. Generate Password
Click on the "Generate" or "Generate Password" button. Google will then generate a unique 16-character password for use with nodemailer.

### 7. Copy the Password
Once the password is generated, copy it to your clipboard. This password is a one-time generated code, so make sure to copy it somewhere safe where you can access it later.

### 8. Use the Password in nodemailer
In your nodemailer configuration, use the generated app password instead of your regular Google account password when setting up the SMTP transporter. Make sure to keep this password secure and don't share it with anyone.

### 9. Test Configuration
After updating your nodemailer configuration with the generated app password, test your email functionality to ensure that nodemailer can send emails using the new password.

By following these steps, you should be able to generate a Google App Password for use with nodemailer and ensure secure email sending from your application.
